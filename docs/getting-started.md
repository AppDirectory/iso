# Getting Started

Iso is a prototyping environment for your Lab UI components.
Create a new Iso file in the same folder as one of your Lab projects.
This will create a new blank `.jsx` file that can access all of the components in your Lab project.

Any changes made in the Lab app will automatically update in Iso.
This includes changes to components and changes to the theme.
